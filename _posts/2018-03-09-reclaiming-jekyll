This is a post I am writing on by Github-based Jekyll site that, if all goes as planned, will be pulled to my Reclaim Hosting-based Jekyll site that I installed the other day at [jekyll.murderinc.biz] (https://jekyll.murderinc.biz). Tim gave me the following instructions:

> Iâ€™m not sure the exact steps but it would involve setting up the repo in Github and cloning it to your hosting account and  > then you could use git commands like ```git pull``` to grab the latest from git (even setup a cron every 10-15 min to do

He was right, that worked seamlessly for me. I was able to clone my Github Jekyll to my Jekyll folder on Reclaim Hosting and simply repoint the DNS to the new directory, i.e. ```jekyll/jimgroom.github.io/_site``` and the site is resolving on Reclaim Hosting at an address other than jimgroom.me (which is where the Github-based Jekyll resolves. It's all very complicated :)

Anyway, this is just a test.
