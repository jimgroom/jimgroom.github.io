Welcome to my first experiment with Jekyll. I've been playing with GitHub all day between getting jimgroom.me mapped on GitHub, and wrapping my head around Jekyll.

Here are some useful sites I used in the process:

This page helped me troubleshoot my custom domain issues when mapping to Github:
https://help.github.com/articles/my-custom-domain-isn-t-working/

This blog post helped me actually map my domain to GitHub cleanly:

This page helped me get up and running with Jekyll:
https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/

Stackoverflow helped me find an answer to the permissions issue I was having when trying to isntall Gem (the Ruby framework that runs Jekyll)
